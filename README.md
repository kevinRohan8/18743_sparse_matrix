18743: Energy efficient sparse matrix multiplication optimizations using different hardware and algorithms.

Sparse matrices form are widely used in modern day applications of big data, data analytics etc. The multiplication of sparse matrices is costly because of the compression algorithm used.

In this project we try and implement various energy efficient sparse matrix multiplication using different hardware and software.
